**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

This software design template was for our client The Gaming Room for the development of a web-based game that can serve the users on multiple platforms. The game was based on the version of their Android Game, Draw It or Lose It which is similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The web-based application should be developed based on the client’s Android app for a similar and familiar user experience for their customer base. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I did particularly well in identifying various design constraints and technical requirements needed for the game application, describing the characteristics of each class based on object-oriented programming used in the game application, evaluating and comparing different operating systems through the perspective of server side and client side, recommending the appropriate operating platform, and storage management service to the client for the game application.  

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Working through the design document provided me with a clear and concise roadmap of all the requirements and specifications needed for the development of the code. The process of working through a design document when developing a code helped understand how all the classes adapt the object-oriented programming and their relationship to each other. It helped me understand what system components such as operating platform, storage, memory, networks, and security best suits the application according to the requirements set by the client.  

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could choose one part of my work to revise in these documents, I would pick the evaluation section of the document to evaluate the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each operating system from the server side and client side. I would research more about the advantages and disadvantages of the servers of different operating systems and how they work in a distributed network system.   

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user’s need by immersing myself in the user’s context and situation and adapting a user-centric approach to solve the challenges in my software design. Understanding the user’s needs and adapting it in our software design meets user expectations, increases user satisfaction, creates positive user experience, and guarantees a final product that effectively accommodates the distinct requirements of every user. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

Designing the software application should be approached by understanding the client’s requirements and interpreting it into the design constraints in our software design document. We should visually design the components of the software application in a UML diagram and outline its characteristics in our software design document. We should evaluate all the operating systems and their components so that we can choose the best platform for our software application or according to the client’s need. We should recommend by analyzing the best operating platform for the software application, what storage management will to choose from, how the memory management will be handled by the chosen platform, how the distributed system and networks will be deployed, and how the security will be handled in the software application so that the client and development team will have a roadmap of the software application way before we start the project.
